This is my hackpad. Feel free to take any code or model that you need😁
The parts I have used are:
 - 19 Cherry MX Switches Brown (or anything quiet and tactile you have. im not picky) normal key size
 - 1 EC11 rotary encoder 20mm
 - 4 of the insets you said to use on the website
 - m3 screws
 - ssd1306 128x32 i2c 0.91" ( I request that if you cannot make it touch the cutout just do not solder it. just put it with the package)
 - xiao rp2040
 - black keycaps
 - for the case colour please do it in carmine red
   Thank you
